Notes on AI creation

*** Game start - adventure interfaces ***
initGameInterface() is called on:
* CPlayerInterface (CPI) for humans
* settings["playerAI"] for computers
  settings["playerAI"] is fixed to "MMAI" (ie. MMAI::AAI), which
  can create battle interfaces as per `redAI` and `blueAI`
  script arguments (this info is passed to AAI via baggage).

*** Battle start - battle interfaces ***
* battleStart() is called on the adventure interfaces for all players

VCAI - (via parent class) reads settings["enemyAI"]) and calls GetNewBattleAI()
MMAI - creates BAI (which makes use of the baggage), StupidAI or BattleAI directly
CPI - reads settings["friendlyAI"]

All adventure AIs have been modified to pass an "AICombatOptions" struct
to the newly created battle interface:
battleAI->initBattleInterface(env, cbc, aiCombatOptions);
it contains autocombat options + a special "other" std::any object which
is non-null if an MMAI model was loaded. BAI uses it for action predictions.

*** Auto-combat button clicked ***
BattleWindow()::bAutofightf() has been patched to reuse code in CPI
(in order to also pass baggage)

Notes on AI deletion
*** Battle end ***
The battleEnd() is sent to the ADVENTURE AI:
* for CPI, it's NOT forwarded to the battle AI (which is just destroyed)
* for MMAI, it's forwarded to the battle AI and THEN the MMAI is destroyed


AI for attacker (red)
When attacker is "MMAI":
 * if headless=true, VCMI will create MMAI::AAI which inits BAI via myInitBattleInterface()
 * if headless=false, it will create CPI which inits BAI via the (default) initBattleInterface()

CPI creates battle interfaces as per settings["friendlyAI"]
=> must set that setting also (see further down)
(Note: CPI had to be modded to pass the baggage)
